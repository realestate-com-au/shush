# Style and conventions

## Traditionally hex settings should use JSON integers, not JSON strings

For example, [`"classID": 1048577`][class-id] instead of `"classID": "0x100001"`.
The config JSON isn't enough of a UI to be worth jumping through string <-> integer hoops to support an 0xâ€¦ form ([source][integer-over-hex]).

## Constant names should keep redundant prefixes

For example, `CAP_KILL` instead of `KILL` in [**`linux.capabilities`**][capabilities]).
The redundancy reduction from removing the namespacing prefix is not useful enough to be worth trimming the upstream identifier ([source][keep-prefix]).

## Optional settings should have pointer Go types

So we have a consistent way to identify unset values ([source][optional-pointer]).
The exceptions are entries where the Go default for the type is a no-op in the spec, in which case `omitempty` is sufficient and no pointer is needed (sources [here][no-pointer-for-slices], [here][no-pointer-for-boolean], and [here][pointer-when-updates-require-changes]).
